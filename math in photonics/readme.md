this course only has oral assessment + two calculation practices (exact result not needed only present how you would do it).

if you can answer all the question after each chapter form the syllabus smoothly you will be fine. (and 20/20 very possible)

example calculation 2023-09

(A)      I = \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{(a + \cos x)^2}  dx    , a > 1 

(B)      dynamic systems: Jacobian matrix
